# üêπ LGrow, the most simplified high-performance language!

- Before, we needed to make this presentation, since this character is VERY important to our story. Since it was and will forever be our first mascot.

# So, let's get to the beginning!

**A language designed for ease, compiled and low level, incredible speed compared to other languages.**

We don't want to turn our ease of use into a joke, so we will use simple and clear syntaxes, similar to JavaScript, Python or GOLang. Of course, we will do the aforementioned with incomparable speed.

**See below a simple use of the language:**

# How does language work?
- **Compiler:** 

The compiler is written in Rust and saves some data from the language's standard modules, which are written in C. There are no tricks, there are compilation phases like those in other languages.

<br>

- **Executables:** 

The executables generated by Grow have the same ByteCode as C, a high-performance executable, including LIBS used within the code, thus making them Rust executables.
